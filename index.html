        <p class="about">
          I am a recent graduate from San Diego State University
          that received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
          I am looking for an entry level software development position
          where I can grow and improve my knowledge as a newfound
          computer scientist. Some of my interests include traveling,
          surfing, attending concerts, and rock climbing.
          <br><br>
          I am personable and a great communicator who is eager to lead. I take pride in my work
          and strive to be the best at anything I do. I take constructive
          criticism well and am always looking to learn. I think outside
          of the box and always try to establish a great connection with
          the other members on my team. I can and will be a great asset
          to your company.

          With mass shootings being something of concern in the US nowadays,
          myself and two peers decided to create an application that utilizes 
          computer vision to recognize a person in possession of a firearm and identify 
          the class of firearm at the same time. This system would be embedded into security 
          cameras and would alert on-site security or local police in the event 
          that a possible shooter is identified. This could minimize or prevent damages caused 
          by said shooter.
          <br>
          The system employs a supervised learning model that was trained with 
          a convolutional neural network. It was trained using thousands of images distinguishing 
          between handguns and rifles.

          This website allows for users to share their favorite locations 
          to hang out at. If a user wants to add a new location, they are prompted 
          to give it a fun name, add photos, directions, and various tags describing 
          the location. This will help users prepare for things like parking, bodies of water, 
          accesibility for the disabled, dog friendliness, type of view, cost, and so much more. Once a location 
          is posted, other users can view it and save it to their favorites if they want to visit. 
          The amount of saves is tracked and will be publicly displayed on the post so people can 
          get an idea of how busy the location might be. Once a user has visited a location, they may 
          leave a review on it in the app with a rating out of 5 stars and comments on their 
          experience.
          <br>
          This website stores all data using MongoDB and is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
          and React. It also utilizes Express.js and Node.js for navigation and package management. 
          Adding and searching for locations uses a connection to the Google Maps API. This connection 
          allows for easy acquisition of location coordinates for data storage purposes.

        <p class="project-desc">
          This application keeps track of orders that a pizzeria receives and hands them off to 
          various delivery services. All orders go through a buffer that is used to keep track 
          of available slots for the food items. In this particular setup, the pizzeria is trying to promote 
          the pizzas more than the sandwiches so they have put a limit on the number of sandwich orders that can be 
          in the buffer at any given time. The number of active orders at one time is also limited so that the pizzeria is 
          not taking on more than they can handle at once. There are multiple delivery services waiting to accept and transport 
          the orders and all transactions are logged for proof of all completed orders.
          <br>
          This multi-threaded system was created entirely using C++ and uses semaphores and a queue for the bounded buffer and barrier.
          All shared data is secured by locks and requires mutually exclusive access.
